I am a second year Computer Science master's student at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). During my master's, I also work closely with [Prof. Thomas L. Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/tom.php).

My research goal is to enable machines to think better by developing AI systems that integrate memory and reasoning, with a primary focus on large language models. I am particularly interested in drawing insights from cognitive psychology to comprehensively assess and understand the 'thought' process of LLMs/VLMs, exploring the interaction and distinctions between memorization and reasoning for both humans and models. I'm also interested in enhancing models' ability to think more effectively, especially design the algorithms to teach models how to improve the thinking process to more adaptively and flexibly in more complex, real-world contexts.

Before Princeton, I received my Bachelor's degree at McGill University, advised by [Prof. Xue (Steve) Liu](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html) and [Prof. Eric D. Kolaczyk](https://sites.bu.edu/kolaczyk/).

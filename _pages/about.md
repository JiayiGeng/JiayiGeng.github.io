I am a second year Computer Science master's student at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). During my master's, I also work closely with [Prof. Thomas L. Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/tom.php).

My research goal is to enable machines to think better by developing AI systems that integrate memory and reasoning. I am particularly interested in (1) drawing on cognitive psychology to develop evaluation frameworks that can provide a comprehensive understanding of the thought processes of LLMs/VLMs, understanding the effects of interaction and distinctions between models' memorization and reasoning; and (2) advancing models' ability to think more effectively, including designing proper algorithms and efficient methods to improve the thinking process that make models more adaptive and flexible in complex, real-world contexts.

Before Princeton, I received my Bachelor's degree at McGill University, advised by [Prof. Xue (Steve) Liu](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html) and [Prof. Eric D. Kolaczyk](https://sites.bu.edu/kolaczyk/).

I am a second year Computer Science master's student at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). During my master's, I also work closely with [Prof. Thomas L. Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/tom.php).

My research goal is to explore and enable machines to engage in better deliberation. More specifically, I am interested in (1) drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology to understand the deep interconnection between machines and humans, particularly focusing on the interplay between memory and reasoning, and (2) designing appropriate algorithms and methods to push the limits of LLM deliberation.

Before Princeton, I received my Bachelor's degree at McGill University, advised by [Prof. Xue (Steve) Liu](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html) and [Prof. Eric D. Kolaczyk](https://sites.bu.edu/kolaczyk/).

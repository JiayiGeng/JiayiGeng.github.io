I am a second year Computer Science master's student at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/). During my master's, I also work closely with [Prof. Thomas L. Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/tom.php).

My research goal is to enable machines to think better by developing AI systems that integrate memory and reasoning, with a primary focus on large language models. I am particularly interested in (1) drawing insights from cognitive psychology to build the evaluation frameworks to comprehensively understand the ‘thought’ process of LLMs/VLMs, exploring the effect of the interaction and distinctions between humans and model's memorization and reasoning; (2) enhancing models’ ability to think more effectively, especially design the algorithms to teach models how to improve the thinking process to more adaptively and flexibly in more complex, real-world contexts.

Before Princeton, I received my Bachelor's degree at McGill University, advised by [Prof. Xue (Steve) Liu](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html) and [Prof. Eric D. Kolaczyk](https://sites.bu.edu/kolaczyk/).

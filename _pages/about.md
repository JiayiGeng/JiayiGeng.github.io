I am an incoming Computer Science PhD student at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/).

My research goal is to explore and enable machines to beyond human intelligence. More specifically, I am interested in (1) drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology to understand the deep interconnection between machines and humans, particularly focusing on the interplay between memory and reasoning, and (2) designing appropriate algorithms and methods to push the limits of LLM deliberation.

Before CMU, I received my Master's degree at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/) and [Prof. Thomas L. Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/tom.php), and my Bachelor's degree at McGill University, advised by [Prof. Xue (Steve) Liu](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html), [Xujie Si](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~six/index.html) and [Prof. Eric D. Kolaczyk](https://sites.bu.edu/kolaczyk/).
